[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?
>> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE
ran = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(ran)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf) <- lines too thick, just one solid block of blue.

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(ran)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf) <- looks pretty close to a line, so it seems pretty uniformly random.
